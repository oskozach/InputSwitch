# InputSwitch

InputSwitch is an Arduino library for handling digital input switches with debounce functionality using a Timer. It allows you to define the switch behavior, including the debounce time, trigger mode (`CHANGE`, `RISING`, `FALLING`), and whether the switch is normally open (NO) or normally closed (NC).
